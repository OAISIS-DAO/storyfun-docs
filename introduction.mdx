# Built for Story Protocol

[Story.fun](http://Story.fun) is built on Story Protocol's IP layer, enabling the perfect combination of AI and intellectual property (IP).

## Why Story Protocol?

Story Protocol provides the first decentralized IP infrastructure that protects and manages creators' intellectual property rights. Building an AI Agent launchpad on this foundation offers the following unique advantages:

- **IP Protection and Transparency**: All AI Agents and the content they generate are registered as IP assets, protecting creators' rights.
- **Automated Royalty Distribution**: When AI Agents learn from or utilize protected IP, appropriate royalties are automatically distributed to rights holders.
- **Standardized IP Governance**: Standardized IP management is possible through the industry's first Proof of Creativity, IP Portal, and TCP/IP infrastructure.

## [Story.fun](http://Story.fun)'s Vision

[Story.fun](http://Story.fun) goes beyond being just a launchpad or exchange, providing an integrated infrastructure for the future of AI and IP. We aim to:

- Provide a platform where creators can easily launch AI Agents while protecting their IP
- Build a transparent and fair value distribution system
- Establish an economic incentive model for a sustainable AI ecosystem
- Support domain-specific AI Agent development through crowdsourced knowledge bases
